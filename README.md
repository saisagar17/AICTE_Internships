## 📊 Model Performance

The Random Forest Regressor model provides:
- Feature importance analysis
- Time series validation
- Multiple evaluation metrics (MAE, MSE, R²)
- Prediction confidence intervals

## 🔧 Usage

1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
```
jupyter notebook EV_Adoption_Forcasting.ipynb
```

2. **Or run as Python script**:
```
The notebook can be converted to a Python script for automated forecasting.
```
