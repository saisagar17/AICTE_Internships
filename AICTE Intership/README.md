# ⚡ EV Adoption Forecasting using Machine Learning

📈 EV Adoption Forecasting
This project focuses on forecasting the adoption trends of Electric Vehicles (EVs) using historical data and machine learning techniques. The goal is to help understand when and how quickly EVs will dominate the automotive market under different scenarios.

🚀 Project Overview
The notebook EV_Adoption_Forcasting.ipynb explores and analyzes EV adoption patterns through:

Data preprocessing and visualization

Time series analysis

Machine learning models for forecasting

Scenario-based predictions

📊 Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of EV adoption trends

Time series forecasting using models like ARIMA or Prophet

Forecast accuracy evaluation

Insightful visualizations to communicate predictions

🧰 Tech Stack
Python

Jupyter Notebook

Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, statsmodels, Prophet (optional)

📈 Sample Forecast Plot
Include a screenshot or plot image here if you’d like, showing an example of the forecast output.

✅ Future Improvements
Incorporate policy and market incentive data

Use deep learning models (e.g., LSTM) for better accuracy

Deploy as an interactive dashboard (e.g., Streamlit or Dash)
