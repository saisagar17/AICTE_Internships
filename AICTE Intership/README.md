# ⚡ EV Adoption Forecasting using Machine Learning

A machine learning project that forecasts electric vehicle (EV) adoption to help urban planners anticipate infrastructure needs, particularly charging stations.

## 🚗 Project Overview

As electric vehicle adoption surges globally, urban planners need accurate forecasting models to anticipate infrastructure requirements. This project builds a regression model to predict future EV adoption based on historical trends, vehicle types, and regional data.

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses electric vehicle registration data from Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL), containing monthly vehicle registration counts separated by county for passenger vehicles and trucks.

### Dataset Features:
- **Date**: Monthly registration counts (2017-01-31 to 2024-02-29)
- **County**: Geographic region where vehicle owner resides
- **State**: Geographic region of the country
- **Vehicle Primary Use**: Passenger (83%) or Truck (17%)
- **Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)**: Count of fully electric vehicles
- **Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)**: Count of hybrid electric vehicles
- **Electric Vehicle (EV) Total**: Sum of BEVs and PHEVs
- **Non-Electric Vehicle Total**: Count of non-electric vehicles
- **Total Vehicles**: All registered vehicles in the county
- **Percent Electric Vehicles**: EV adoption percentage

**Data Source**: [Kaggle - Electric Vehicle Population Size 2024](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sahirmaharajj/electric-vehicle-population-size-2024)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ev-adoption-forecasting.git
cd ev-adoption-forecasting

2. Install required packages:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn joblib


3. Download the dataset:
   - Place `Electric_Vehicle_Population_Size_History_By_County_.csv` in the project directory

## 📈 Model Features

The forecasting model includes sophisticated feature engineering:

- **Time-based features**: Months since start, seasonal patterns
- **Lag features**: Previous 1-3 months EV totals
- **Rolling statistics**: 3-month moving averages
- **Growth metrics**: Percentage changes and growth slopes
- **Cumulative metrics**: Total EV adoption over time
- **Categorical encoding**: County and state information

## 🔧 Usage

1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:

jupyter notebook EV_Adoption_Forcasting.ipynb


2. **Or run as Python script**:
The notebook can be converted to a Python script for automated forecasting.

## 📊 Model Performance

The Random Forest Regressor model provides:
- Feature importance analysis
- Time series validation
- Multiple evaluation metrics (MAE, MSE, R²)
- Prediction confidence intervals

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, date parsing, and feature scaling
- **Feature Engineering**: Creates lag features, rolling statistics, and growth metrics
- **Model Training**: Random Forest with hyperparameter tuning
- **Evaluation**: Comprehensive model performance metrics
- **Visualization**: Charts showing trends, predictions, and feature importance
- **Forecasting**: Ability to predict future EV adoption rates
